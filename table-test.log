A number should have been here; I inserted `0'.
(If you can't figure out why I needed to see a number,
look up `weird error' in the index to The TeXbook.)

! Undefined control sequence.

The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.

! Extra \fi.

I'm ignoring this; it doesn't match any \if.

! Missing number, treated as zero.

I can't carry out that multiplication or division,
since the result is out of range.

Things are pretty mixed up, but I think the worst is over.
